Questions Answered:
Q1 (2 points). Write SQL commands to create the above tables (create your own column names), and populate them with data (as many/few rows as you see fit, eg. 25 employees, 15 meetings... you can start small, and add more rows later, to help write queries for Q2..Q5).

Q2 (1 point). Write a query to output the most-self-reported symptom.

Q3 (1 point). Write a query to output the 'sickest' floor.

Q4 (1 point). Create your own query! What else would you like to learn, from the data? Describe/list the question, and come up with the query to answer it. You'll get 1 extra point if your query involves table division
